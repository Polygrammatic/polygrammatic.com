              Kayak is a first person survival experience where the player discharges themselves from society and goes
              on a self-exploratory
              journey across the ocean on a kayak to become free. After land is long gone, and supplies start to
              dwindle, the paddler needs
              to continue to navigate towards their destination, sustain, and survive, as they will not thrive. Enter
              the player.
              <br>
              <br>
              Utilising HDRP, Unity and considered game design, Kayak is an artistic piece within a dynamic setting
              designed to take the player on a journey of their own.

However, there are some ingenious gameplay functions to this game. First off, the tape behaves like a tape!? If you move a certain amount of time on the ‘A’ side you the have the same time on the ‘B’Side. So this game isn’t just a point-to-point platformer. The player needs to use that functionality to navigate their way through the game. Christo tells us that his passion lays first and foremost in GAMEPLAY. And, from the fleeting amount of time we were able to spend at the consistently popular Super Mixtape stand, we could really see that. Both in the aforementioned twist on the generic platformer style and, that in the game ‘physics’. The movement of your noble ‘C60-esque’ recording / playback medium is executed with almost a graceful manner. Add to this the way Polygrammatic have engineered the environment to be ‘active’ in partnership with the soundtrack and we think you have a brilliant exposition of what a platform game can be!\”",

The players ranged from 7 years old up to 55+ years old, and a medium percentage of players completed the game. At EGX the game was the 5th most rated game out of 113 games, and scored 4.62 out of 5 on the EGX application. Following EGX the game got interest from 5 publishers, some small venture capital investors and someone in the music industry. I have been talking to two of the publishers and one of the VC investors as well as the guy in the music industry and have a meeting with him on Tuesday, but I need to get solid details before progressing with any of the deals, and they need to see a solid project plan for the rest of the game with fixed milestone dates in them. They will be fronting the cash, and the money won’t be released until a milestone is complete. I’m working on getting EGX costs back as well, as EGX cost me well over £2k to do in booth, swag etc. The game was the most popular single developer game at EGX. I managed to score some journos a few weeks before EGX and had people like machinima come around and do a small interview and some other cats, but we have got some really nice quotes and feedback to put alongside the documents I will be sending to publishers:",

You are able to swap between the two different sides of a cassette tape to change the environment around you; or for those born towards the late ‘90s, that probably made no sense whatsoever.

Doing so alters the music as well as the environment, certain coloured platforms are only activated when a certain type of music is playing. It’s a curious way to use music as a game mechanic to alter the environment and is very effective once you get a hang of the movement/tumble controls.
